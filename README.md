# Tumor Diagnosis With Seaborn

## Exploratory data analysis with seaborn

For this project I used Seaborn to discover and explore the relationships in the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+(diagnostic))">Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) data set</a>. Below are the tasks copmleted for this project: 

### **Task 1:** Introduction and Importing the Data

### **Task 2:** Separate Target from Features

Seperate target features into a new dataframe.

### **Task 3:** Diagnosis Distribution Visualization

Let's use seaborn countplot() to look at the diagnosis distriubition between benign and malignant tumors.

We can use dataframe.describe() to get a summary of our data. dataframe.describe() provides descriptive statistics that summarize the central tendency, dispersion and shape of a datasetâ€™s distribution, excluding NaN values.

### **Task 4:** Visualizing Standardized Data with Seaborn

Use violin plot to visualize standarized data.  We can look at the separation between the median values to determine whether this would be a good feature to use for classification.

### **Task 5 :** Violin Plots and Box Plots

A boxplot is useful for detecting outliers amont the features in the data set.

### **Task 6:** Using Joint Plots for Feature Comparison 

This joint plot is an effective way of visualizing correlation between two feartures in a data set.

### **Task 7:** Observing the Distribution of Values and their Variance with Swarm Plots

Swarm plot does a really good job of showing which features may have better predictive power than others.

### **Task 8:** Observing all Pairwise Correlations

A correlation plot shows relatiopnship between all features in the dataset within one table.  The color coded results enable anlaysts to quickly identify where strong correlation exists.
