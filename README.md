## Exploratory data analysis with seaborn

For this project I used Seaborn to discover and explore the relationships in the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+(diagnostic))">Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) data set</a>. Below are the tasks copmleted for this project: 

**Task 1:** Introduction and Importing the Data

**Task 2:** Separate Target from Features

**Task 3:** Diagnosis Distribution Visualization

**Task 4:** Visualizing Standardized Data with Seaborn

**Task 5 :** Violin Plots and Box Plots

**Task 6:** Using Joint Plots for Feature Comparison 

**Task 7:** Observing the Distribution of Values and their Variance with Swarm Plots

**Task 8:** Observing all Pairwise Correlations
